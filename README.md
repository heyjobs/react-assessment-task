# HeyJobs React Assessment Task
Thank you for taking the time to complete this test task! The purpose of the task is to get an idea of your development style: how you tackle a problem, the way you structure your code, your testing strategy, etc.

## Requirements
Build a React application which:
  * Displays a list of available jobs.
  * Clicking on a job in the list will bring the user to a page which displays all details of the job.
  
You should create and use dummy data for the list of jobs. We suggest the following format:

```	 
[
 {
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Frontend Developer",
  "description": "Comfortable with modern JS stack, experience with React.",
  "employment_type": "full_time"
 }
]
```

[Here](https://stackshare.io/heyjobs/frontend) is our tech stack, though you are free to approach the problem as you see fit.

The use of a app starter such as Create React App is ok

Note: Don't fork this repository. Create your own repository and send us a link to it. You may describe some of the assumptions you made in the README file of your repository.

**Have fun!**
